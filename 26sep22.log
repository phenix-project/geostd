Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 289; net charge: 0
Info: The number of electrons is odd (289).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 279; net charge: 0
Info: The number of electrons is odd (279).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 173; net charge: 0
Info: The number of electrons is odd (173).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 125; net charge: -1
Info: The number of electrons is odd (125).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 185; net charge: 0

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: For atom (ID: 9, Name: OXT) the best APS is not zero.
         Bonds involving this atom are frozen.
Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 153; net charge: -1

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 155; net charge: -1
Info: The number of electrons is odd (155).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 17; net charge: 0
Info: The number of electrons is odd (17).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: For atom (ID: 1, Name: PB) the best APS is not zero.
         Bonds involving this atom are frozen.
Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 41; net charge: 1

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 143; net charge: -2
Info: The number of electrons is odd (143).

Warning: For atom (ID: 7, Name: SN7) the best APS is not zero.
         Bonds involving this atom are frozen.
Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 139; net charge: 0
Info: The number of electrons is odd (139).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).
Info: Total number of electrons: 139; net charge: -1
Info: The number of electrons is odd (139).
      Please check the total charge (-nc flag) and spin multiplicity (-m flag).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or 
(2) adjust atom valence penalty parameters in APS.DAT, and/or 
(3) increase PSCUTOFF in define.h and recompile bondtype.c
    (be cautious, using a large value of PSCUTOFF (>100) will 
    significantly increase the computation time).

Warning: The assigned bond types may be wrong, please :
(1) double check the structure (the connectivity) and/or
